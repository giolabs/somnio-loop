## What it does

You hand `somnio-loop` a ticket — a free-text prompt, a Jira/Linear/GitHub Issues ID, or a paragraph pasted directly — and the plugin runs the full loop end-to-end without further input:

1. **Triage** decomposes the ticket into phases and picks the right archetype per phase
2. **Sub-agents fan out in parallel** waves (Sonnet for analysis, Haiku for audit, Opus for final synthesis)
3. **Self-healing** runs your project's verification commands (lint, typecheck, tests, build) and retries on failure — language-agnostic
4. **Spec generator** produces a validated 20-section spec when the ticket implies code work
5. **ADR generator** records architectural decisions with codebase analysis and PR conflict detection
6. **Verifier executes the suite** (no theater) before the spec-writer (Opus) assembles the final artifact
7. **Run report** with per-agent consumption, prompts, and a machine-readable trace lands in `.loop/`

The plugin is **technology-agnostic** by design. It discovers your stack from manifests (`package.json`, `pubspec.yaml`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `mix.exs`, `*.csproj`, and 60+ others) and your conventions from `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and the `.rules` family (`.cursorrules`, `.windsurfrules`, `.clinerules`, `.roorules`). It works on Flutter, React, Next.js, NestJS, Rails, Spring, Go services, Rust binaries — anything with a discoverable manifest.

## Quick install

```bash
# 1) Add the marketplace
claude plugin marketplace add giosomniodev/somnio-loop

# 2) Install the plugin
claude plugin install somnio-loop@somnio-loop

# 3) Verify
claude plugin list | grep somnio-loop
```

That's it. No further configuration required for first run.

## First run

In any project, inside Claude Code:

```
somnio-loop:do "Investigate the last 3 TypeScript releases and write a 300-word summary."
```

(Or simply `do "..."` if your environment resolves without collision.)

You will see, in order:

```
🎚 Readiness level: L1 (report-only) — first run on this repo.
🎛 Autonomy: balanced (default from .loop/config.yaml)
```

Then triage → workers → verifier → spec-writer → consolidated summary with the per-agent consumption table.

Expected: ~3–5 minutes, ~$0.30–$0.50 USD for a research ticket of this size.

## The five archetypes

| Archetype | When triage picks it | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **orchestrator-workers** | N independent sub-tasks | Research 5 bundlers in parallel |
| **plan-execute** | Sequential pipeline with data flow between steps | Extract → transform → load |
| **generate-spec** | Development ticket needs a contract before code | Implement a feature with tests |
| **adr** | Architectural decision detected (verbs like *adopt*, *migrate*, *replace*; new tech, infra, data model, API design) | "Use Redis for session caching" |
| **self-healing** | Code phase with verification commands | Workers in isolated `git worktree`s + verifier executes the suite + retry on failure (max 3 per file) |

Triage may combine archetypes into a 2–4 phase plan: ADR → spec → self-healing → PR description.

## Autonomy presets

Configurable per-project in `.loop/config.yaml` or per-run via `--autonomy=<preset>` appended to the ticket.

| Preset | Behavior | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| `minimal` | Maximum autonomy. Verifier auto-fix up to 2 retries. PR conflicts logged and continued. Spec clarifications marked TBD instead of asking. Status updates posted without confirmation. | Repetitive tickets, batch jobs, after a calibration period. |
| `balanced` *(default)* | Asks when human judgment adds value, proceeds when it doesn't. The behavior shipped through v0.4.x. | First weeks in any new project or ticket archetype. |
| `high` | Approval gate before every write. Up to 10 clarification questions. "Continue?" after each phase. | Sensitive areas — auth, billing, production infra, regulatory compliance. |
| `custom` | Per-gate override. | When presets don't fit your specific risk profile. |

```bash
# Override per ticket
do "Migrate auth to Riverpod 2 --autonomy=minimal"
do "Change pricing engine --autonomy=high"
```

Six configurable gates: `budget_gate`, `verifier_blocking_gate`, `adr_conflict_gate`, `adr_rule_violation_gate`, `spec_clarification_gate`, `self_healing_exhaust_gate`. Full schema in [`references/autonomy-config.md`](references/autonomy-config.md).

## Optional MCP integrations

The plugin **does not bundle its own MCP servers**. It discovers whatever you have connected to Claude Code via `ToolSearch` and adapts.

| Integration | Tools the plugin uses | Benefit |
|---|---|---|
| **Jira (Atlassian Remote)** | `getJiraIssue`, `editJiraIssue`, `addCommentToJiraIssue` | `do TKT-123` fetches the full ticket; status auto-updates to `In Review` post-run |
| **GitHub** | `get_issue`, `create_pull_request`, `list_pull_requests` | Ticket fetch from issues, PR draft creation, ADR conflict detection at diff level |
| **Linear** | `get_issue`, `update_issue`, `create_comment` | Same flow as Jira |
| **Slack / Teams / Discord** | `send_message` | Post run summaries to your team's channel |

Configure them in `.loop/config.yaml` under `mcp_integrations`. Full vendor adapter details in [`references/mcp-integrations.md`](references/mcp-integrations.md).

## Safety floor (non-negotiable)

These six rules apply to every preset, including `minimal`:

1. **Never auto-merge PRs.** Plugin produces a branch and a PR description; humans merge.
2. **Never push to `main`, `master`, `production`, or `release/*`.**
3. **Never write to denylist paths** (`.env`, `secrets/`, `infra/production/` + project-specific additions).
4. **Never silently override a documented rule** in `.rules`/`AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`. The plugin asks or aborts — never `proceed`.
5. **PR always opened as draft.** You upgrade to "ready for review" manually.
6. **Ticket status capped at `In Review`.** Never `Done` / `Closed` automatically.

       └─→ adr-author (Sonnet) — if ADR-worthy
       └─→ spec-refiner (Haiku) + spec-validator (Sonnet) — if dev ticket
```

**Model ladder:** Opus runs once per ticket (spec-writer only). Sonnet runs N workers + triage + runtime + analysis. Haiku runs the cheap audit. The triage refuses to assign Opus to anything but the spec-writer.

## Conventions read on first run

The plugin reads the following on every run (all optional — it falls back to manifest inference if none exist):

**Layer 1 — Architecture docs**
`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `CONVENTIONS.md`, plus `docs/` equivalents, plus nested `**/CLAUDE.md`.

**Layer 2 — AI behavior rules**
`.cursorrules`, `.windsurfrules`, `.clinerules`, `.roorules`, `.aider.conf.yml`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.continue/config.json`. Each rule becomes a constraint on the ADR's `Alternatives Considered` table.

**Layer 3 — Project type classification**
Frontend (React/Vue/Svelte/Solid/Angular/Qwik), Mobile (Flutter/React Native/Expo/Swift/Kotlin), Backend (NestJS/Express/Django/FastAPI/Rails/Spring/Go/Rust), Full-stack (monorepos with Nx/Turbo/Bazel).

**Layer 4 — Sub-type deep scan**
Per-stack additional context: state management deps, routing, testing framework, ORM/schema, infrastructure as code.

## State spine — `.loop/`

The plugin owns a single directory at your repo root, created on first run:

```
.loop/
├── state.md              # high priority / watch list / conventions snapshot
├── run-log.md            # append-only history (1 entry per run)
├── budget.md             # daily/weekly caps + kill switch + denylist paths
├── config.yaml           # autonomy preset + 6 gates + MCP integrations
├── traces/<ts>.json      # machine-readable trace per run
└── plans/<ts>.yml        # archived plan.yml per run
```

`state.md`, `run-log.md`, `budget.md`, and `config.yaml` are inspectable text files — review-friendly, commit them if your team wants shared memory. `traces/` and `plans/` are excluded by the default `.gitignore`.

## Roadmap

| Version | Focus |
|---|---|
| **v0.7.x** *(current)* | Bug fixes, ergonomics, public stabilization |
| v0.8 | `loop:audit` skill (Loop Readiness Score) + `loop:cost` (pre-run token estimator) |
| v0.9 | `loop:improve` — meta-loop that reads `.loop/traces/` history and refactors prompts/topologies (hill-climbing) |

## Foundations

`somnio-loop` is a productization of "Loop Engineering" — the design discipline articulated by:

- **Addy Osmani** — [Loop Engineering essay](https://addyosmani.com/blog/loop-engineering/)
- **Boris Cherny** (Head of Claude Code, Anthropic) — *"I don't prompt Claude anymore. I have loops running that prompt Claude. My job is to write loops."*
- **Cobus Greyling** — [loop-engineering reference repository](https://github.com/cobusgreyling/loop-engineering) — anti-patterns and failure modes baked into the triage agent's self-check.
- **LangChain** — [The Art of Loop Engineering](https://www.langchain.com/blog/the-art-of-loop-engineering)

This plugin formalizes their patterns as a one-command interface on top of Claude Code's sub-agent and skill primitives, with strong safety floors, configurable autonomy, and durable state.

## Contributing

Patterns, MCP adapters, language-specific verification commands, and anti-patterns from production incidents are all welcome. Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening a PR.
